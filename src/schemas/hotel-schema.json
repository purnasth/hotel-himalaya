Great laundry service available. Breakfast buffet was delicious. Dinner restaurant was great!!! Service was 100 points. The only 'bad' thing was that the wifi was only available at the lobby, not in the room.",

First, it's one of the cleanest properties around, with great ambience - including clean rooms, toilets, and swimming pool. Secondly, the staff is extremely polite and helpful. They are always so homecoming and supportive. They will talk to you and connect on a personal level - be it the security staff at the gate or restaurant staff or reception. Food is excellent, the breakfast has a lot of varieties.",
